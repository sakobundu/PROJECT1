<h3>History: </h3>
</div>

<div><p>The African graduate student community here at Brown, is relatively  small especially in the STEM field. Thus, it can be easily isolating and difficult for students of African descent to find a community that feels like home. We have decided to start this student-led organization called Graduate African Student Organization or GASO.</p></div>

<div>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
</div>


<div>
<ul>
		<li>To provide a sense of community for African graduate students here at Brown.</li> 
        <li>To bring African perspectives to STEM and the Humanities (not necessarily about race but provide insight to the African continent).</li> 
        <li>To amplify African voices (in other words, create a sense of representation; again, not necessarily about race).</li> 
        <li>To pay forward by serving as mentors and resources to Undergraduate African students here at Brown.</li> 
        <li>A place of refuge - a place where African Graduate students can freely express their ideas and grievances without fear of stigma.
</li>
