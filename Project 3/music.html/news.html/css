	<p style="font-family:verdana"> <p style="font-size:17px">Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born on January 28, 1985, at a U.S. Army base in Frankfurt, then in West Germany. His father, an African American soldier, left his mother, a white German postal worker, when Cole was a baby. She moved with him and his older brother, Zach, to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where the family lived in trailer parks as she struggled to make ends meet. </p>
    
    
    <p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">It was in Fayetteville that Cole's passion for music found an early outlet when he joined the Terry Sanford Orchestra as a violinist. He also began to teach himself rapping and production, rapping first as Blaza, then as Therapist — “We used to look through the dictionary for rap names,” he recalled later — before hooking up with a local group called Bomm Sheltuh. </p>



	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">He held down a number of part-time jobs as a teenager while he honed his production skills, including a stint at an ice hockey rink where he had to dress up as a kangaroo mascot. After graduating from high school, Cole moved to New York and attended St John’s University, graduating magna cum laude in 2007 with a degree in communications.</p>
    
    
	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Getting Signed to Roc Nation:
His debut mixtape, The Come Up, also came out in 2007. It was largely self-produced, but also saw him rapping over beats from Kanye West, Large Professor and Just Blaze. A track called "Lights Please" from his second mixtape, The Warm Up (2009), came to the attention of the producer and music exec Mark Pitts, who played it to Jay Z.</p> 


	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Ironically, Cole had attempted to give Jay Z a copy himself, after waiting outside a studio to meet his idol for three hours — only to be rebuffed with the line “Man, I don't want that shit.” But Pitts had Jay Z's ear, and the mogul was impressed with what he heard. Cole signed to Roc Nation and started to appear as a guest on tracks by Wale, Jay Z and Talib Kweli.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">They're back! Less than a month after J. Cole and Puma re-released the RS-Dreamer sneaker, the duo announced the next silhouette in their Dreamer lineup.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">The RS-Dreamer Proto, a personal favorite of the rapper and his label Dreamville, features a sleek, white and grey Puma Hoops design with pink, neon green and blue detail.</p>



<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">The RS-Dreamer Proto is set to launch this Friday (April 2) in both adult and kid sizes. The shoe, available on puma.com and Foot Locker, plus the Puma NYC Flagship Store, will retail at $125 (adult) and $90 (kid).</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Puma and Dreamville's Dreamer Contest is still underway, aiming to "rejuvenate and re-energize the mind, body and spirit of athletes and dreamers everywhere," according to a press release. </p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">One lucky winner and up to four guests will earn a flight to North Carolina on the Puma Jet, a surprise experience from Dreamville, a VIP meet up with NBA star LaMelo Ball and a private training session with trainer Chris Brickley. The winner will also receive all the Puma Dreamer shoes released until December and a $20,000 cash prize. </p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Enny on being starstruck: ‘I froze watching J Cole’.</h1>
<h4>By Olive Pometsey,

<h3>The first time you were starstruck…?</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">I went to a J Cole concert in 2015 and I’m a really big fan. He was asking people in the audience what song they wanted to hear from his old songs and then he pointed at me. I completely froze like an idiot and just put my hand down. Then he was like, “Oh, she put her hand down!”.</p>
