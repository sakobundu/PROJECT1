	<p style="font-family:verdana"> <p style="font-size:17px">Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born on January 28, 1985, at a U.S. Army base in Frankfurt, then in West Germany. His father, an African American soldier, left his mother, a white German postal worker, when Cole was a baby. She moved with him and his older brother, Zach, to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where the family lived in trailer parks as she struggled to make ends meet. </p>
    
    
    <p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">It was in Fayetteville that Cole's passion for music found an early outlet when he joined the Terry Sanford Orchestra as a violinist. He also began to teach himself rapping and production, rapping first as Blaza, then as Therapist — “We used to look through the dictionary for rap names,” he recalled later — before hooking up with a local group called Bomm Sheltuh. </p>



	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">He held down a number of part-time jobs as a teenager while he honed his production skills, including a stint at an ice hockey rink where he had to dress up as a kangaroo mascot. After graduating from high school, Cole moved to New York and attended St John’s University, graduating magna cum laude in 2007 with a degree in communications.</p>
    
    
	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Getting Signed to Roc Nation:
His debut mixtape, The Come Up, also came out in 2007. It was largely self-produced, but also saw him rapping over beats from Kanye West, Large Professor and Just Blaze. A track called "Lights Please" from his second mixtape, The Warm Up (2009), came to the attention of the producer and music exec Mark Pitts, who played it to Jay Z.</p> 


	<p style="font-family:verdana"><p style="font-size:17px">Ironically, Cole had attempted to give Jay Z a copy himself, after waiting outside a studio to meet his idol for three hours — only to be rebuffed with the line “Man, I don't want that shit.” But Pitts had Jay Z's ear, and the mogul was impressed with what he heard. Cole signed to Roc Nation and started to appear as a guest on tracks by Wale, Jay Z and Talib Kweli.</p>
